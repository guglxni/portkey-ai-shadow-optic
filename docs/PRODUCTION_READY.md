#  Shadow-Optic: Production Ready Status

##  Critical Fixes Implemented

Based on the comprehensive code review, all critical gaps have been addressed:

### 1.  **Prometheus Metrics Middleware** - FIXED
**Issue:** Grafana dashboard would be empty without metrics endpoint.

**Solution:**
- Added `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` to requirements.txt
- Instrumented FastAPI app in `src/shadow_optic/api.py`
- Metrics now exposed at `/metrics` endpoint
- Grafana can now scrape metrics from `shadow-optic-api:8000/metrics`

**Code Change:**
```python
from prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator import Instrumentator

app = FastAPI(...)
Instrumentator().instrument(app).expose(app)
```

**Status:**  COMPLETE - Verified working, all tests pass

---

### 2.  **Configuration Bootstrapping** - FIXED
**Issue:** No way to upload configs to Portkey and capture config IDs.

**Solution:**
- Created `scripts/bootstrap_portkey.py`
- Uploads `production-config.json` and `shadow-config.json` to Portkey
- Captures returned config IDs
- Writes IDs to `.env` file automatically
- Includes verification step

**Features:**
- Rich terminal UI with progress indicators
- Error handling with actionable messages
- Verification that configs exist in Portkey cloud
- Automatic `.env` file updates

**Status:**  COMPLETE - Ready for use

---

### 3.  **Demo Data Generation** - NEW
**Issue:** Need realistic production traffic for demo.

**Solution:**
- Created `scripts/seed_traffic.py`
- Generates 50+ diverse requests across 7 categories:
  - Coding (Python, JS, SQL)
  - Writing (emails, blogs, docs)
  - Analysis (comparisons, trade-offs)
  - Math & Logic problems
  - Business (metrics, strategy)
  - Conceptual explanations
  - Debugging scenarios
- Progress bars and statistics
- Configurable concurrency and model selection

**Status:**  COMPLETE - Ready for demo

---

### 4.  **Pre-Flight Verification** - NEW
**Issue:** No automated way to verify all components are ready.

**Solution:**
- Created `scripts/preflight_check.py`
- Comprehensive checks:
  - Environment variables
  - Python package installation
  - Portkey API connectivity
  - Qdrant connectivity
  - Temporal connectivity
  - Portkey config existence
- Beautiful terminal report with pass/fail status
- Actionable error messages with fix commands

**Status:**  COMPLETE - Ready for verification

##  Launch Sequence (Demo Day)

### Pre-Demo Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Bootstrap Portkey
export PORTKEY_API_KEY=your_key
python scripts/bootstrap_portkey.py

# 3. Start services
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Verify readiness
python scripts/preflight_check.py
```

### Live Demo (10 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Show clean Portkey dashboard
open https://app.portkey.ai/logs

# 2. Generate traffic (LIVE)
python scripts/seed_traffic.py --count 30
# Shows progress bar, categories, latency stats

# 3. Wait for logs to sync (2 min)
# Show logs appearing in Portkey dashboard

# 4. Trigger optimization
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/optimize

# 5. Show Temporal workflow
open http://localhost:8233
# Watch activities execute:
#   - Export logs 
#   - Semantic sampling 
#   - Shadow replays 
#   - LLM evaluation 
#   - Cost analysis 

# 6. Show results
open https://app.portkey.ai/feedback
# Shadow quality scores visible!

# 7. Show cost metrics
open http://localhost:3000
# Grafana dashboard with cost savings
```
